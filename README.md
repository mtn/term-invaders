# term-invaders

A terminal implementation of the classic arcade game space invaders built in C with GNU ncurses. Pull requests welcome.

## Credits

I used ascii character representations from [makuru](https://github.com/maraku). They're really awesome and so much better than what I would have done otherwise! The original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/maraku/invaders). I want to modify them eventually to add movement between frames.
