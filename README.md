## Credits

I used ascii character representations created by [asib](https://github.com/asib), with slight modification. They're really awesome and so much better than what I would have done otherwise! Besides... they were a lot easier to work with than "prettier" but painful to process non/extended ascii) The original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/asib/spaceinvaders) (MIT License).
