# term-invaders

A terminal implementation of the classic arcade game space invaders built in C with GNU ncurses. Pull requests welcome.

## Credits

I used ascii character representations from [asib](https://github.com/asib). They're really awesome and so much better than what I would have done otherwise (and also a lot easier to work with than "prettier" but painful to process non/extended ascii)! The original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/asib/spaceinvaders).
