# term-invaders

A terminal implementation of the classic arcade game space invaders built in C with GNU ncurses. It's my second game! Contributions/comments welcome.

## Usage

Clone repository and `cd` into the directory:

    git clone git@github.com:mtn/term-invaders && cd term-invaders

Build the executable by running `make` and run with `./invaders` :space_invader:

## Credits

I used ascii character representations created by [asib](https://github.com/asib), with slight modification. They're really awesome and so much better than what I would have done otherwise! Besides... they were a lot easier to work with than "prettier" but painful to process non/extended ascii) The original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/asib/spaceinvaders) (MIT License).
